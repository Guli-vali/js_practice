Here's his story.", "content": "My entrepreneurial journey with Ampush began with a blend of youthful curiosity and ambition, sparked during my time at Goldman Sachs. While the prestige was undeniable, I yearned to build something tangible.\n Conversations with my college roommates, Nick and Chris, ignited our fascination with Facebook's burgeoning advertising platform. At 25, we saw an untapped potential in pioneering performance marketing on this new frontier. It wasn't a meticulously planned venture, but rather a leap into the unknown, driven by the thrill of exploration.\n We validated our idea through a scrappy, hands-on approach, running small ad campaigns for local businesses and experimenting with Facebook's capabilities. The promising results quickly revealed the scalability of our concept. Landing Uber as a client marked a pivotal moment, validating our vision and execution prowess." },
